    "# AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) Progress Prize 3\n",
    "\n",
    "## Competition Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **third AIMO Progress Prize competition**, building upon:\n",
    "- **First Prize (July 2024)**: Won by Project Numina\n",
    "- **Second Prize (April 2025)**: Won by Nvidia's NemoSkills team\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of AIMO3:\n",
    "- **Significantly increased problem difficulty**: 110 problems spanning algebra, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory\n",
    "- **Problem difficulty range**: From National Olympiad level to IMO standard (pinnacle of high school mathematics)\n",
    "- **New submission format**: Dual-answer system with penalized accuracy scoring\n",
    "- **Expanded prize pool**: Part of $10mn AIMO Prize fund\n",
    "- **Industry-leading compute resources** for participants\n",
    "- **Auxiliary prizes** to reward community contributions\n",
    "- **Updated rules** for using open-source LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to reason mathematically is a critical milestone for AI. Current AI capabilities show a significant gap between closed-source and open-source models:\n",
    "- Closed-source models achieved **gold medal performance** at 2025 IMO\n",
    "- OpenAI x AIMO eval (March 2025): Commercial models solved **50/50 AIMO2 problems**\n",
    "- Highest Kaggle score was only **34/50**, demonstrating the gap\n",
    "\n",
    "AIMO3 is designed to **accelerate open-source progress** and close this gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Design\n",
    "\n",
    "- **100% original problems**: Created by international team of problem solvers\n",
    "- **Zero risk of train-test contamination**\n",
    "- **\"AI hard\" design**: Tested against current open LLMs' capabilities\n",
    "- **Genuine mathematical reasoning required**: Answer-only testing is robust\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public Leaderboard (During Competition)\n",
    "- Evaluated on **public test set only**\n",
    "- Score = **unnormalized accuracy** (number of correct answers)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Private Leaderboard (Final Evaluation)\n",
    "- Submission notebooks run **twice** over private test set\n",
    "- Predictions concatenated into single submission file\n",
    "- **Penalized accuracy scoring**:\n",
    "  - **Both answers correct**: 1.0 point\n",
    "  - **One answer correct**: 0.5 points\n",
    "  - **Neither answer correct**: 0.0 points\n",
    "- **Overall score**: Sum of scores for all problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer Format\n",
    "- All ground-truth labels are **integers between 0 and 99999** (inclusive)\n",
    "- Any modulo calculation is **explicitly stated** in problem statement\n",
    "- **No implicit modulo 1000** (change from AIMO1 and AIMO2)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a solution using:\n",
    "1. **Data exploration and preprocessing**\n",
    "2. **LLM-based mathematical reasoning** with prompt engineering\n",
    "3. **Multiple solving strategies** to generate diverse solutions\n",
    "4. **Dual-answer submission** system for robust evaluation"

    "6. ✅ **Creates submission.csv** file\n",
    "\n",
    "### To Improve Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Integrate Real LLM**\n",
    "Replace `solve_with_llm_placeholder` with actual LLM calls:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example with OpenAI\n",
    "import openai\n",
    "response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n",
    "    model=\"gpt-4\",\n",
    "    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": solver.create_prompt(problem)}]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Use Open-Source Models**\n",
    "For Kaggle submission, consider local models:\n",
    "- **Llama 3** (70B or 405B)\n",
    "- **Qwen 2.5** (Math specialized)\n",
    "- **DeepSeek-Math**\n",
    "- **Mistral Large**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Implement Symbolic Math**\n",
    "Integrate SymPy for exact symbolic computation:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sympy as sp\n",
    "# Parse problem and solve symbolically\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Add Verification**\n",
    "- Check answer validity within problem context\n",
    "- Verify calculations\n",
    "- Test edge cases\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Optimize Prompts**\n",
    "- Include few-shot examples\n",
    "- Add chain-of-thought prompting\n",
    "- Use problem-type specific prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Ensemble Methods**\n",
    "- Combine multiple models\n",
    "- Use majority voting\n",
    "- Implement confidence scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "### Competition Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dual-Run Optimization:**\n",
    "- Run 1: Use most reliable strategy\n",
    "- Run 2: Use diverse/alternative strategy\n",
    "- This maximizes partial credit (0.5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus Areas:**\n",
    "1. **Algebra**: Pattern recognition, equation solving\n",
    "2. **Combinatorics**: Counting, probability\n",
    "3. **Geometry**: Spatial reasoning, coordinate geometry\n",
    "4. **Number Theory**: Modular arithmetic, divisibility\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Competition Page**: ai-mathematical-olympiad-progress-prize-3\n",
    "- **Reference Problems**: Check the PDF in data folder\n",
    "- **Previous Competitions**: Study AIMO1 and AIMO2 winning solutions\n",
